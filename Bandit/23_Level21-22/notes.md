## Bandit Wargame: Level 21 â†’ Level 22 Walkthrough

### ðŸŽ¯ Level Goal

The objective of this level is to find the password for **Bandit Level 22** by analyzing a **cron job**. A cron job is a scheduled task that runs automatically on a Unix-like system. The problem description hints that the cron configuration is located in the `/etc/cron.d/` directory.

### ðŸ’¡ Methodology

1.  **Locate the Cron Job**: First, list the contents of the `/etc/cron.d/` directory to identify the relevant cron job file.
2.  **Inspect the Cron Job**: Read the contents of the identified file to understand what command or script is being executed.
3.  **Analyze the Script**: The cron job points to a shell script. Inspect this script to see how it handles the password. The script will reveal where the password is being stored or what is being done with it.
4.  **Retrieve the Password**: The password is being redirected to a temporary file in the `/tmp/` directory. The script reveals the name of this file. Use the `cat` command to read the contents of this temporary file and retrieve the password.

### ðŸ’» Commands Used
