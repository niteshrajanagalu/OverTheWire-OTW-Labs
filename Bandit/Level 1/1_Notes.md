2. **List files and find the password**

* Checked the contents of the home directory:
ls
ls command lists all the contents of the current directory(Home)
* Found a file named "-"

* Viewed the contents of the file to get the password:

cat ./-
Here ./ refers to the current directory and ensures that the file named "-" is treated as a normal file instead of stdin/stdout.

- If a file has tricky names like "-" use ./filename or quotes.
- Always check the home directory first for files.
- Screenshots help remember SSH connections and commands used.
