# Bandit Wargame: Level 25 ‚Üí Level 26

## Goal

The goal is to log in to `bandit26`. We're told that the user's shell is not `/bin/bash`. We need to figure out what the shell is, how it works, and how to escape it to find the password for the next level.

-----

## Solution Walkthrough

### 1\. Initial Connection & Discovery

First, let's log in to `bandit25` using the password from the previous level.

Now, let's try to SSH into `bandit26`.

```bash
bandit25@bandit:~$ ssh bandit26@localhost
```

When you connect, you'll be immediately disconnected. This confirms that the shell for `bandit26` is not an interactive one like `bash`. It executes something and then exits, closing the connection.

### 2\. Identifying the Custom Shell

We need to find out what program is being used as the shell for `bandit26`. This information is stored in the `/etc/passwd` file. Let's examine it from our `bandit25` shell.

```bash
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
```

The last field in the output, `/usr/bin/showtext`, is the user's configured shell. Let's examine this script to see what it does.

```bash
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/showtext
#!/bin/sh

more /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26.password
exit 0
```

The script simply displays the password file for `bandit26` using the `more` command and then exits. The problem is that it exits so quickly we can't read the password.

### 3\. Escaping the `more` Command

The `more` command is a terminal pager used to view the contents of a text file one screen at a time. If the text fits in the terminal window, `more` displays it and exits immediately. This is why our SSH session closes instantly.

To escape this, we need to force the `more` command to pause and wait for user input.

1.  **Resize Your Terminal:** Make your local terminal window very small (short). This ensures the text from the password file won't fit on one screen, forcing `more` to pause at the end of the first page.

2.  **Connect to bandit26:** Run the SSH command again.

    ```bash
    ssh bandit26@localhost
    ```

3.  **Enter the Editor:** Now that `more` is paused and waiting for input, press the `v` key. This is a standard `more` command that opens the current file in the system's default editor, which is typically `vi` or `vim`.

4.  **Spawn a Shell from `vi`:** You are now inside the `vi` editor. From here, you can execute shell commands. Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```vim
    :set shell=/bin/bash
    ```

    Then, type this command and press Enter:

    ```vim
    :shell
    ```

    This will drop you into a fully functional `bash` shell.

### 4\. Retrieving the Password

You now have a shell as the `bandit26` user. Simply read the password file to get the flag for the next level.

```bash
bandit26@bandit:~$ whoami
bandit26

bandit26@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
[...password is revealed here...]
```

Here's a screenshot showing the `vi` shell escape and password retrieval.

## Explanation üßê

The core of this challenge is a **shell escape**. The user `bandit26` was configured with a restricted shell (`/usr/bin/showtext`) that was designed to perform a single action and then terminate.

Our exploit path was:

1.  **Manipulate the Environment:** By resizing the terminal, we changed the behavior of the `more` command, preventing it from exiting automatically.
2.  **Leverage Program Features:** We used a built-in feature of the `more` program (pressing `v` to edit) to launch a more powerful application (`vi`).
3.  **Execute Arbitrary Commands:** The `vi` editor allows users to run external commands, including spawning a new shell. By launching `/bin/bash` from `vi`, we successfully bypassed the intended restrictions of the original custom shell.

## Password for Level 26

The password is found in the `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit26` file after successfully escaping the restricted shell. It has been hidden here to avoid spoilers.
